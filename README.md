# Namb-ed
    Namb-ed is a simple text editor built on top of the ncurses library,and utilizes the Train string and array manipulation library for the text related manipulation

# Plans
    I do plan in making this a usable text editor like vim,and a way to make custom keybinding,but for now im focused on a notepad-like text editor.
